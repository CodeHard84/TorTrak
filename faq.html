    <h2>What is Enhanced Fujita (EF)?</h2>
    <p>The Enhanced Fujita (EF) tornado rating system is a scale used to categorize tornadoes based on their intensity
      and the damage they cause. Developed by a team led by Dr. Ted Fujita, the EF scale was introduced in 2007 as an
      enhancement to the original Fujita scale, which had been in use since the 1970s. The EF scale ranges from EF0 to
      EF5, with EF0 being the weakest and EF5 being the strongest tornadoes.

      The EF scale assesses tornado intensity by examining the damage inflicted on structures and vegetation. It
      considers factors such as the degree of damage to buildings, the strength of winds required to cause that damage,
      and the distribution of damage along the tornado's path. Each EF category corresponds to a range of estimated wind
      speeds, which helps meteorologists and emergency responders gauge the severity of a tornado event.

      The EF scale incorporates modern engineering and scientific knowledge to provide more accurate and consistent
      tornado intensity ratings compared to its predecessor. It takes into account various types of structures and
      construction materials, as well as the vulnerability of different building designs to tornado forces.
      Additionally, the EF scale considers damage indicators such as trees, signage, and vehicles to assess wind speeds
      and assign an appropriate rating.

      By providing a standardized and systematic approach to tornado intensity classification, the EF scale enhances our
      understanding of tornado behavior and helps communities prepare for and respond to tornado events more
      effectively. It facilitates communication among meteorologists, emergency managers, researchers, and the public,
      enabling better-informed decisions regarding tornado safety and mitigation efforts.</p>
